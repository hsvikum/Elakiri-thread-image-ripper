<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Elakiri.com is filled with awsome threads.Specially some with grate images.But it's a hassel to go through each page reading through comment after comment just to find the next image 3 pages later.

This project exsists because:
* I'm too lazy and sleepy to go through 100's of pages at 2 AM in the morning :smile:.
* Needed to try out Puppeteer for some automation work and have a reference code i can look up.

Hope others facing similar issue will find this tool usefull.
